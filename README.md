# insert-clever-app-name-here
This is a personal project that I've wanted to build for nearly 2 years, but have only recently started to aquire the technical skills to start bringing it into fruition. I am building a full stack garden design / harvest planning / community connection application. 

## Vision
I want to make the process of planning, harvesting and sharing small scale crops in your own back yard easy and fun. I also want to connect those with skills, land, time and resources (a combination of these or perhaps only one), so that we can rely less on importing food from around the country.

## How?
My intention is to build an application that can do many things (so may branch this out into components that can connect together as/when needed, giving users the option to use one, some or all features). **Note: User stories, MVP, stretch TBC.

**Garden design:**
* Input garden details (size, location, date, food preferences etc)
* App will present initial design for user to modify (dynamic, fun to use, drag/drop ability, pleasing graphics)

**Harvesting calendar and planning tool:**
* Once garden design complete, app produces calendar for planting and harvesting.
* Ability to share calendar with friends/neighbours
* Calendar provides guidance on how-to's (basic instruction for those not blessed with the green thumb)

**Connection:**
* Ability to register as someone who has land and/or ability and/or time and/or resources
* Search / connect / create network for the one or various gardens user may be involved with
* Utilise existing social networks / calendars or create own? Don't want to reinvent the wheel, but also don't want to have dependency / added complication of linking in with (potentially multiple) other sources and be beholden to their terms, updates, features...

## Next Steps
- [ ] Finish up some other repos before getting stuck into this one... I'm looking at you [https://github.com/rosie-b/creAnimals](creAnimals).
- [ ] Start a personal blog about this and tell all my friends. Maybe they want to join in? Maybe they want to send me hilarious jokes that are themed around gardening? Maybe they will never look at it but still smile politely and pretend that they have read it when we meet at social events? I'm making this weird. 
- [ ] Set up the bones for insert-clever-app-name-here, so that I've got somewhere to start and apply new learnings and ideas as they come.
- [ ] ?
- [ ] A beautiful working app that somehow funds my life now.

**Disclaimer:**
There is every chance that in the time I have taken to write this that an app meeting all of the above has already been created and is a raging success. I'm still going to build my one, just for fun.
